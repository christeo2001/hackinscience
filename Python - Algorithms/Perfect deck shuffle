## Create a function that takes in a list and shuffles it by halving the deck and interleaving them

def perfect_shuffle(deck):
    a = (deck[0: len(deck)//2])
    b = (deck[len(deck)//2: len(deck)])
    
    newDeck = []
    
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(a):
        newDeck.append(a[i])
        newDeck.append(b[i])
        i += 1
        
    return newDeck
    
print(perfect_shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))
##  [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
