## Write a function that prints the first n numbers of the fibonacci sequence

def fibonacci(n):
    sequence = [0,1]
        
    if n == 0:
        sequence = []

    else:
        for i in range(2,n+1):
            next_num = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
            sequence.append(next_num)
        sequence.remove(0)
    return sequence
